# Peroxibase
This project aims to provide a pipeline of tools for doing sequence alignment, protein analysis, and homology analysis

## Step 1: get the protein sequence from RedoxiBase

## Step 2: homology and protein motif analysis on MEME site

## Step 3: sequence alignment with Baker's yeast using Blastp algorithm

## Step 3: multiple sequence alignment(MSA) and phylogeneic tree analysis
